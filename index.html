<h3>Brief Description</h3>
<p>What you’ll do:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SLIs/SLOs &amp; contracts:</strong> Define customer-centric SLIs/SLOs for Tier-0/Tier-1 services. Publish, review quarterly, and align teams to them.</li>
<li><strong>Error budgeting (policy &amp; tooling):</strong></li>
<li>Run the error-budget policy with multi-window, multi-burn-rate alerts; clear runbooks and paging thresholds.</li>
<li>Gate changes by budget status (freeze/relax rules) wired into CI/CD.</li>
<li>Maintain SLO/EB dashboards (Azure Monitor, Grafana/Prometheus, App Insights). Run weekly SLO reviews with engineering/product.</li>
<li>Drive roadmap tradeoffs when budgets are at risk; land reliability epics.</li>
<li><strong>Incidents without drama:</strong> Lead SEV1/SEV2, own comms, run blameless postmortems, and make corrective actions stick.</li>
<li><strong>Engineer reliability in:</strong> Multi-AZ/region patterns (active-active/DR), PDBs/Pod Topology Spread, HPA/VPA/KEDA, resilient rollout/rollback.</li>
<li><strong>AKS at scale:</strong> Harden clusters (network, identity, policy), optimize node/pod density, ingress (AGIC/Nginx); mesh optional.</li>
<li><strong>Observability that works:</strong> Metrics/traces/logs with Azure Monitor/App Insights, Log Analytics, Prometheus/Grafana, OpenTelemetry. Alert on symptoms, not noise.</li>
<li><strong>IaC &amp; policy:</strong> Terraform/Bicep modules, GitOps (Flux/Argo), policy-as-code (Azure Policy/OPA Gatekeeper). No snowflakes.</li>
<li><strong>CI/CD reliability:</strong> Azure DevOps/GitHub Actions with canary/blue-green, progressive delivery, auto-rollback, Key Vault-backed secrets.</li>
<li><strong>Capacity &amp; performance:</strong> Load testing, right-sizing, autoscaling; partner with FinOps to reduce spend without hurting SLOs.</li>
<li><strong>DR you can trust:</strong> Define RTO/RPO, test backups/restore, run game days/chaos drills, validate ASR and multi-region failover.</li>
<li><strong>Secure by default:</strong> Entra ID (Azure AD), managed identities, Key Vault rotation, VNets/NSGs/Private Link, shift-left checks in CI.</li>
<li><strong>Reduce toil:</strong> Automate recurring ops, build self-service runbooks/chatops, publish golden paths for product teams.</li>
<li><strong>Customer escalations:</strong> Be the technical owner on calls; communicate tradeoffs and recovery plans with authority.</li>
<li><strong>Document to scale:</strong> Architectures, runbooks, postmortems, SLIs/SLOs—kept current and discoverable.</li>
<li><strong>(If applicable) Streaming/ETL reliability:</strong> Apply SRE practices (SLOs, backpressure, idempotency, replay) to NiFi/Flink/Kafka/Redpanda data flows.</li>
</ul>
<h3>How we’ll measure success (first 12 months)</h3>
<ul>
<li>100% of Tier-1 services have published SLOs with error budgets and burn-rate alerts in place.</li>
<li>Error-budget depletion before window end ↓ 40%; fast-burn alerts route within 5 min and include a rollback path.</li>
<li>MTTR ↓ 30% and incident recurrence ↓ 40% on top offenders.</li>
<li>Alert quality: ≥80% actionable; pages per on-call shift stable or declining.</li>
<li>Change failure rate &lt;15% with automated rollback always available.</li>
<li>Toil ↓ 30% via automation; ≥50% time on engineering vs. reactive ops.</li>
<li>DR drills pass agreed RTO/RPO across Tier-1 services.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Preferred Skills/Minimum qualifications</h3>
<ul>
<li>Bachelor’s in CS/Engineering (or equivalent experience).</li>
<li><strong>12+ years</strong> in production ops/platform/SRE, including <strong>5+ years on Azure</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>PostgreSQL (must-have):</strong> Deep operational expertise incl. HA/DR, logical/physical replication, performance tuning (indexes/EXPLAIN/ANALYZE, pg_stat_statements), autovacuum strategy, partitioning, backup/restore testing, and connection pooling (pgBouncer). Prefer experience with Azure Database for PostgreSQL – Flexible Server.</li>
<li><strong>Azure core:</strong> AKS (must-have); Front Door/App Gateway, API Management, VNets/NSGs/Private Link, Storage, Key Vault, Redis, Service Bus/Event Hubs.</li>
<li><strong>Observability:</strong> Azure Monitor/App Insights, Log Analytics, Prometheus/Grafana; SLO design and error-budget operations.</li>
<li><strong>IaC/automation:</strong> Terraform and/or Bicep; PowerShell and Python; GitOps (Flux/Argo). Pipelines in Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions.</li>
<li>Proven incident leadership at scale, blameless postmortems, and SLO/error-budget governance with change gating.</li>
<li>Mentorship and crisp written/verbal communication.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Preferred (nice to have)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Apache NiFi, Apache Flink, Apache Kafka or Redpanda (self-managed on AKS or managed equivalents); schema management, exactly-once semantics, backpressure, dead-letter/replay patterns.</li>
<li>Azure Solutions Architect Expert, CKA/CKAD.</li>
<li>ITSM (ServiceNow), on-call tooling (PagerDuty/Opsgenie).</li>
<li>Compliance/SecOps (SOC 2, ISO 27001), policy-as-code, workload identity.</li>
<li>OpenTelemetry, eBPF tooling, or service mesh.</li>
<li>Multi-tenant SaaS and cost optimization at scale.</li>
</ul>
<h3>How we work</h3>
<ul>
<li>Follow-the-sun on-call for Tier-1 services.</li>
<li>Data over opinions. Postmortems are blameless; fixes are mandatory.</li>
<li>Pragmatic automation: if it’s run twice, script it. If it’s run weekly, productize it.</li>
