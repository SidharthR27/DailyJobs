<p><strong>Behaviour &amp; Anomaly Analysis:</strong>
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover traffic patterns, bursts, outliers, and security events across IPs, headers, user agents, and geo data.
- Translate findings into new or refined ML features and anomaly indicators.</p>
<p><strong>Visualisation &amp; Dashboards:</strong>
- Create time-series, geo-distribution, and behaviour-pattern visualisations for internal dashboards.
- Partner with frontend engineers to test UI requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Monitoring &amp; Scaling:</strong>
- Implement health and latency monitoring for pipelines; automate alerts and failure recovery.
- Scale infrastructure to support rapidly growing log volumes.</p>
<p><strong>Collaboration &amp; Documentation:</strong>
- Work closely with ML, security, and product teams to align data strategy with platform goals.
- Document data lineage, dictionaries, transformation logic, and behavioural assumptions.</p>
<h3>Minimum Qualifications</h3>

<li>Data modelling, versioning, and time-series handling</li>
<li>Familiarity with visualisation tools (Kibana, Grafana)</li>
