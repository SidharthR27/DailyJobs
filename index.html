<p><strong>Contact Email:</strong> jobs@macrosoftindia.com</p>
<p><strong>Closing Date:</strong> 01, Oct 2025</p>
<p><strong>Job Description:</strong>
The ideal candidate should have a strong foundation in business analysis—specifically in creating detailed requirement documents from the ground up—and possesses the rare technical skill of understanding and documenting complex COBOL programs. Your primary mission will be to analyze legacy programs and produce a clear, comprehensive "blueprint" (BRDs and Functional Specifications) that will guide the successful migration and inform development in new technologies.</p>
<p><strong>Job Responsibilities:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Translate Code into Business Requirements:</strong> You will perform functional decomposition of COBOL programs, JCL, and Unix scripts. Your goal is to go beyond just reading the code; you will trace data flows and process logic to meticulously document the "what" and "why". Your deep understanding of the documented COBOL programs will be the foundation for all future development.</li>
<li><strong>Author the Blueprint for Modernization:</strong> You will be the primary author of our migration roadmap. This involves creating exceptionally detailed Business Requirement Documents (BRDs) and Functional Specification Documents (FSDs). These documents will include process flows, explicit business rules, data mappings, and use cases. They must be so thorough that a developer with zero knowledge of the legacy system can use them to accurately build its modern equivalent.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Preferred Skills/Qualifications:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Proven Business Analyst Experience:</strong> Minimum 5+ years of experience as a Business Analyst, with a proven track record of creating comprehensive BRDs and Functional Specifications.</li>
<li><strong>COBOL Documentation Expertise:</strong> Must have significant, hands-on experience (at least 2+ years) where a primary responsibility was analyzing, understanding, and formally documenting the business logic contained within COBOL programs, JCL, and related mainframe assets.</li>
<li><strong>Demonstrated Documentation Mastery:</strong> A portfolio or ability to discuss in detail past projects where you created BRDs/FSDs from scratch by reverse-engineering legacy code.</li>
<li><strong>Technical Acumen:</strong> Strong ability to read and interpret COBOL and JCL. Solid understanding of UNIX environment.</li>
<li><strong>Exceptional Communication Skills:</strong> A unique ability to translate complex technical details from source code into clear, unambiguous business and functional requirements for non-technical stakeholders.</li>
<li><strong>Education:</strong> A Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Information Systems, or a related field.</li>
