<li>Write <strong>unit tests</strong> using <strong>Jest</strong> and <strong>end-to-end tests</strong> using <strong>Playwright</strong>.</li>
<li>Develop a responsive, theme-able UI using <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong>, design tokens, and a component-driven architecture.</li>
<li>Collaborate closely with UX/UI designers to transform wireframes and mocks into polished, user-friendly interfaces (dashboards, side panels, widgets).</li>
<li>Prioritize performance, scalability, and clean architecture across all modules and features.</li>
<li>Identify and refactor technical debt, and mentor more junior engineers.</li>
<li>Participate actively in code reviews, design discussions, and planning sessions.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Required Skills &amp; Experience</h3>
<ul>
<li>Strong experience with <strong>React + TypeScript</strong> (hooks, context, component composition, patterns).</li>
<li>Solid <strong>Node.js</strong> skills; experience with <strong>Fastify</strong> is preferred (Express is acceptable).</li>
<li>Experience with state management solutions other than Redux (e.g., Zustand, Recoil, Jotai).</li>
<li>Deep understanding of <strong>MongoDB</strong> (schema modeling, queries, transactions, indexing, performance tuning).</li>
<li>Proficiency with <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong>, utility-first styling, responsive design, and theming.</li>
<li>Proven experience writing <strong>unit tests</strong> and <strong>E2E tests</strong> (Jest, Playwright, or equivalent).</li>
<li>Solid grasp of <strong>REST APIs</strong>, concurrency, locking/session management, and distributed systems fundamentals.</li>
<li>Familiarity with <strong>Docker</strong> for containerization and some exposure to Kubernetes or orchestration.</li>
<li>Strong software architecture sense, modular design, clean code practices, and the ability to reason about scaling.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Nice-to-Haves</h3>
<ul>
<li>Experience integrating <strong>Monaco Editor</strong> or building web-based IDE / contract editors.</li>
<li>Knowledge of <strong>Azure Key Vault</strong>, <strong>Azure API Management (APIM)</strong>, or API lifecycle tools.</li>
