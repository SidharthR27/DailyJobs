<h3>Brief Description</h3>
<p>We’re building a next-generation API management platform designed for developers and administrators to onboard, edit, and govern APIs with high performance, real-time validation, and intelligent tooling. We believe in owning end-to-end solutions, building intuitive, maintainable systems, and enabling developers with the tools they deserve.</p>
<h3>Role Overview</h3>
<p>As a Senior Full-Stack Engineer, you will own the development of our editor hub, dashboard, and supporting backend services. You will be responsible for delivering a responsive, scalable, and maintainable product, collaborating with product, design, and infrastructure teams. You’ll influence architecture, state management strategy, and modular component design.</p>
<h3>Key Responsibilities</h3>
<ul>
<li>Design, implement, and evolve a React + TypeScript front-end for an editor-centric enterprise application.</li>
<li>Integrate Monaco Editor for real-time contract editing (OpenAPI specs) with syntax highlighting, validation, and error reporting (e.g. via Spectral).</li>
<li>Manage application state using lightweight frameworks (e.g. Zustand, Recoil), avoiding unnecessary Redux complexity.</li>
<li>Build Fastify-based Node.js backend services to support API validation, schema management, session/lock handling, and integrations.</li>
<li>Model, query, and operate on data via MongoDB (schema design, aggregation pipelines, transactions, indexing).</li>
<li>Write unit tests using Jest and end-to-end tests using Playwright.</li>
<li>Develop a responsive, theme-able UI using Tailwind CSS, design tokens, and component-driven architecture.</li>
<li>Collaborate closely with UX/UI designers to turn wireframes and mocks into polished, user-friendly interfaces (dashboards, side panels, widgets).</li>
<li>Prioritize performance, scalability, and clean architecture across modules and features.</li>
<li>Identify and refactor technical debt; mentor more junior engineers.</li>
<li>Participate in code reviews, design discussions, and planning sessions.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Required Skills &amp; Experience</h3>
<ul>
<li>Strong experience with React + TypeScript (hooks, context, component composition, patterns).</li>
<li>Solid Node.js skills; experience with Fastify preferred (Express acceptable).</li>
<li>Experience with state management solutions other than Redux (Zustand, Recoil, Jotai, etc.).</li>
<li>Deep understanding of MongoDB (schema modeling, queries, transactions, indexing, performance tuning).</li>
<li>Proficiency with Tailwind CSS, utility-first styling, responsive design, and theming.</li>
<li>Proven experience writing unit tests and E2E tests (Jest, Playwright or equivalent).</li>
<li>Solid grasp on REST APIs, concurrency, locking / session management, and distributed systems fundamentals.</li>
<li>Familiarity with Docker for containerization (and some exposure to Kubernetes or orchestration).</li>
<li>Strong software architecture sense, modular design, clean code practices, and ability to reason about scaling.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Nice-to-Haves</h3>
<ul>
<li>Experience integrating Monaco Editor or building web-based IDE / contract editors.</li>
<li>Knowledge of Azure Key Vault, Azure API Management (APIM), or API lifecycle tools.</li>
<li>Experience in CI/CD pipelines, automated deployments, cloud-native architectures.</li>
<li>Past work on collaborative or multi-user real-time applications (CRDTs, OT, conflict resolution).</li>
<li>Familiarity with distributed locks, Redis, or similar concurrency tooling.</li>
</ul></div>
