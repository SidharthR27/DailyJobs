- Create time-series, geo-distribution, and behavior-pattern visualizations for internal dashboards.
- Partner with frontend engineers to test UI requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Monitoring &amp; Scaling:</strong>
- Implement health and latency monitoring for pipelines; automate alerts and failure recovery.
- Scale infrastructure to support rapidly growing log volumes.</p>
<p><strong>Collaboration &amp; Documentation:</strong>
- Work closely with ML, security, and product teams to align data strategy with platform goals.
- Document data lineage, dictionaries, transformation logic, and behavioral assumptions.</p>

- Elasticsearch &amp; ELK stack query optimization
- SQL for ad-hoc analysis
- Workflow orchestration (Apache Airflow, Prefect or similar)
- Data modeling, versioning, and time-series handling
- Familiarity with visualization tools (Kibana, Grafana)
