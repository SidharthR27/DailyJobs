You will work closely with the Associate Technical Manager (who handles delivery/metrics) while you ensure the technical integrity of the solution.</p>\n<p><strong>Responsibilities</strong>\n- Take full architectural responsibility for specific products or core modules (e.g., the Production Planning Engine or Payroll Calculation System).\n- Translate business requirements into technical design documents (TDDs), defining data models, API contracts, and class structures before coding begins.\n- Proactively identify \"spaghetti code\" or technical debt in our legacy Java/MSSQL systems and design safe refactoring plans to modernize them.\n- Be the final approver for critical code merges. You do not just check for bugs; you check for maintainability, security, and scalability.\n- Deep dive into database execution plans (Oracle/MSSQL) and application logic to optimize slow queries and reduce latency.\n- Enforce consistent design patterns (Singleton, Factory, Observer, etc.) across the development team to ensure the codebase remains uniform.\n- Act as the \"Problem Solver in Chief\" for the development team. When a developer is stuck on a complex logic issue, you provide the solution.\n- Mentor Senior Developers on how to write clean, efficient, and testable code. Conduct technical workshops on new frameworks or best practices.</p>\n<p><strong>Qualifications</strong>\n- <strong>8 to 12 years</strong> of software development experience, with at least <strong>2+ years</strong> in a Software Architect Role.\n- Expert in <strong>Java/J2EE</strong> (Spring, Hibernate, Multithreading).\n- Strong proficiency in <strong>MSSQL or Oracle</strong> (Stored Procedures, Indexing, Partitioning).\n- Solid understanding of <strong>Angular component architecture</strong> (even if you don't write CSS daily, you understand the data flow).\n- Strong grasp of <strong>Object-Oriented Design (OOD)</strong>, <strong>Microservices patterns</strong>, and <strong>RESTful API design</strong>.\n- Experience with <strong>CI/CD pipelines</strong> (Jenkins/GitLab), <strong>Docker</strong>, and code quality tools (SonarQube).\n- Proven ability to debug complex production issues (memory leaks, thread deadlocks) under pressure.</p>\n<p><strong>Contact Information</strong>\nIf this opportunity aligns with your career goals, kindly share your updated resume with us at <strong>careers@ctebs.com</strong>.</p>",
